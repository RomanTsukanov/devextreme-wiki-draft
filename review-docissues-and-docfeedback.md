# Review DocIssues and DocFeedback

[Not Reviewed DocIssues and DocFeedback](https://internal.devexpress.com/supportstat/DocIssuesMasterView/?teamName=DevExtreme&filter=NotReviewed)

When you review a DocIssue or DocFeedback, first try to understand what the issue is about. If you can't, contact the issue's author for clarification. Then, edit the subject and the body so that the issue became clearer.

Once you're done with the contents, move on to classifying the issue. Go to the right-hand menu and do the following:

- Check that DocIssue Type is correct.

    DocIssue Type         | Description 
    --------------------- | ----------- 
    No code snippet       | Topic needs a code snippet
    Bad code snippet      | Topic contains a code snippet, but it has issues
    Obsolete info         | Topic contains obsolete information
    Doc structure         | Topic's structure doesn't help a user to find and understand information
    Insufficient info     | Some information is missing 
    Empty topic           | Topic doesn't have a description
    No doc for a scenario | A frequent use-case that isn't covered in the docs
    Bug                   | An issue that should be fixed ASAP
    Positive Feedback     | User feedback that recognizes our good work
    Unusable Feedback     | User feedback that doesn't have value (gibberish, support center questions, hateful messages, etc.)

- Set DocIssue Status to Active if the issue is relevant or Close if it is not.

- Check that Doc URL and Platform and Product are correct.

    NOTE: If the platform is ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core, but the issue is not specific to this platform only, change the platform to HTML JS. If the issue is specific to ASP.NET leave this issue **not reviewed**&mdash;it will be taken care of by ASP.NET techwriters.

- Choose the correct Component.     
If you can't find one, the Platform and Product field has a wrong value, and you need to correct it. If that doesn't help, PM a support engineer (for example, Artem Kurchenko), ask him to add a new component to the list.

- Choose the correct Feature.       
If there's no suitable one, PM a support engineer.
