# Review DocIssues and DocFeedback

[Not Reviewed DocIssues and DocFeedback](https://internal.devexpress.com/supportstat/DocIssuesMasterView/?teamName=DevExtreme&filter=NotReviewed)

When you review DocIssues and DocFeedback, follow the steps below:

1. Try to understand what the issue is about. If you succeeded, move on to step 2. If not, contact the issue's author for clarification. Then, edit the title and the body so that the issue became clearer.

1. In the right-hand menu:

    - Check that DocIssue Type is correct.

        | DocIssue Type | Description |
        | ------------- | ----------- |
        | No code snippet       | Topic needs a code snippet
        | Bad code snippet      | Topic contains a code snippet, but it has issues
        | Obsolete info         | Topic contains obsolete information
        | Doc structure         | Topic's structure doesn't help a user to find and understand information
        | Insufficient info     | Some information is missing 
        | Empty topic           | Topic doesn't have a description
        | No doc for a scenario | A frequent use-case that isn't covered in the docs
        | Bug                   | An issue that should be fixed ASAP
        | Positive Feedback     | User feedback that recognizes our good work
        | Unusable Feedback     | User feedback that doesn't have value (gibberish, support center questions, hateful messages, etc.)

    - Set DocIssue Status to Active if the issue is relevant or Close if not.

    - Check that Doc URL and Platform and Product are correct.
        NOTE: If the platform is ASP.NET MVC or ASP.NET Core, but the issue is not specific to this platform only, change the platform to HTML JS. If the issue is specific to ASP.NET leave this issue **not reviewed**.

    - Choose the correct Component. If you can't find one, select a correct Platform and Product. If that doesn't help, PM a support engineer (for example, Artem Kurchenko), ask him to add a new component to the list.

    - Choose the correct Feature. If there's no suitable one, PM a support engineer.
