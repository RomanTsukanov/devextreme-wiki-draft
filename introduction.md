DevExtreme documentation sources are located on GitHub: https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-documentation/

The sources are mainly .md files. A document consists of one or several of such files. Markdown from these files is processed by our website project into valid HTML/CSS.

Here are three main steps that you do when you author a document:

1. Edit .md files.

2. Run the website on your machine and check that your edits are displayed as they should.

3. Push changes to GitHub.
